Academia utilizes [WebSocket for Python](https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python) package for real-time WebSocket communication.

To calculate diffs between notes versions it uses [DiffMatchPatch portable library](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) 

Random data for development phase is generated via [Nonsense](http://freecode.com/projects/nonsense) random text generator.
